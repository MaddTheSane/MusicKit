This constitutes the only MusicKit documentation that is authored in HTML
(not converted from DocBook SGML) and is also the only documentation
that is stored on the sourceforge site. It really only functions as a
bootstrap to where the doco really is.

<h1>Where to find information about the MusicKit and SndKit</h1>
Nearly all documentation is in 
<a href=http://www-tei.uic.edu/orgs/tei/sgml/teip3sg/index.html>SGML</a>
<a href=http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/documentation/reference/html/docbook.html>DocBook</a> format
in the repository, which is then rendered to HTML and uploaded to the
homepage, so the <a href=http://musickit.sourceforge.net>homepage</a>
is the best URL to visit for nearly all questions regarding the
project. It is the README for the project online.<p>

A PDF version of the README/homepage will be bundled in the source
release, although at the moment problems with the SGML parser (jade)
prevent this.</p>

Documentation for the MusicKit and SndKit are in the process of
conversion to DocBook to be available online. 
The 
<a href=http://musickit.sourceforge.net/MusicKitConcepts>Concepts Book</a>
and a set of
<a href=http://musickit.sourceforge.net/TutorialClasses>Tutorials</a>
are available and are also accessible via the homepage. Class
documentation is currently in RTF and is available in the
repository/source releases.<p>

The MusicKit and SndKit are standard sourceforge archives, so learn
how to use sourceforge!<p>
