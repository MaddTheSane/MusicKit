  @class SndStreamClient
  @brief A stream client is responsible for audio streaming, signal processing and synthesis.

  A SndStreamClient provides basic streaming services such as double buffering, thread
  handling, automatic start up and and shut down of lower-level streaming services.  Each
  SndStreamClient instance has a SndAudioProcessorChain instance, so each client can be
  part of a signal processing chain.

  To interpret the operation and performance of the input and output queues, the output
  queue holds the empty (ready to be modified), buffers in the pending portion of the queue, and
  the synthesised (waiting to be played), buffers in the processed portion of the
  queue. Conversely, the input queue's processed portion holds those buffers which have
  been read and processed and are free to be overwritten with newly received data, while
  the pending portion of the queue holds recorded audio that is yet to be processed.
  Therefore, the [inputQueue pendingBuffersCount] indicates the amount of system input
  latency, [outputQueue processedBuffersCount] indicates the amount of system output
  latency.

  In the processing thread, the input operation is to retrieve ("pop")
  the next available pending buffer. Additionally, the output operation is to pop the next available
  pending buffer. The input synth buffer is then used to process and synthesise into the
  output synth buffer. That output synth buffer is then processed via an
  SndAudioProcessorChain and pushed onto the output buffer queue for retrieval by the
  playback engine.
